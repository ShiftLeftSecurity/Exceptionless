    <description>A comprehensive library for working with Semantic Versions (2.0.0), version ranges (node-semver v6.0.0), and Monotonic Versions (1.2).</description>
    <releaseNotes>This minor update adds new features and corrections.
        
### Features
        
 o Advanced version range syntax is now supported
   Support for 'node-semver' caret, tilde, hyphen, and X-range operators in
   VersionRange is added, allowing more complex comparisons to be done simply.
      
 o Semantic versions can now be parsed greedily
   By passing the [ParseMode.Greedy] flag, the [SemanticVersion] parser can now
   be configured to attempt to return a valid version at the first error it
   encounters. This is intended to allow including information after a version
   string that the caller is able to handle.
   
 o Semantic version parser now exposes [IEnumerator(char)] to callers
   This enables a caller to pick up where the parser left off. Used in
   combination with greedy parsing, it makes the job of the caller in
   processing anything stored after a version string easier. It would, for
   example, make converting a [System.Version] of '1.0.0.0' to a semantic
   version easier than it is currently.
   
 o Version range comparisons are no longer transparently memoized
   The [VersionRange] class now exposes an instance [MemoizationAgent] member,
   which enables caching the results of comparisons and which is disabled by
   default. This enables consumers to provide their own caching mechanism
   without potentially causing unexplained high memory usage.
   

### Bug fixes

 o Version range comparisons where one [SemanticVersion] has pre-release
   identifiers and the other doesn't are now performed correctly. Prior to
   this, a comparison would be erroneously performed if the right-hand version
   had identifiers and the left-hand version didn't.</releaseNotes>
